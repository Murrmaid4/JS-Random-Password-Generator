Here is my Random Password Generator repo and files
## Random Password Generator

Here we have a random password generator that prompts to enter a password length between 8-128 by pressing the generate button

You will receive an error alert if  a letter or number less than 8 or greater than 128 is entered. 

## Confirms

Once desired password length is entered it will ask via confirmation box whether the password needs to include upper, lower, numeric or special characters and a random password is generated based on said parameters.
